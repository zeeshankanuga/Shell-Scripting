# Optimizing Logging Architecture with ELK(Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) Stack and S3
## Overview
In our organization, log collection is critical for monitoring and debugging across various platforms. We currently aggregate logs from multiple sources including:

- Microservices
- Kubernetes
- Jenkins build pipelines
- Financial systems

All these logs are collected centrally using the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). While this provides a powerful observability platform, the volume of logs—especially from Jenkins—has significantly increased the operational cost of the ELK stack.

## Problem
Jenkins build logs, while useful, are not as critical for day-to-day monitoring compared to microservices or financial logs. Continuing to push these logs into Elasticsearch leads to:

- Increased storage costs
- Reduced performance for querying critical logs
- Unnecessary load on ELK components

## Solution
To optimize costs and maintain log visibility where it matters most, we’ve migrated all Jenkins logs to Amazon S3, a more cost-effective storage option.

## Implementation Details
- Log Redirection: All Jenkins logs are now sent to a designated S3 bucket instead of Elasticsearch.
- Organized Storage: Logs are stored in S3 structured by date, making it easier to locate logs when needed.
- Automatic Cleanup: After successful upload to S3, corresponding logs are deleted from the Jenkins server to free up local disk space.
- S3 Lifecycle Policies:
Logs older than 30 days are automatically transitioned to S3 Glacier Deep Archive.
This ensures long-term retention at minimal cost, while still meeting compliance and audit requirements.

## Benefits
- ✅ Reduced ELK stack storage usage and costs
- ✅ Maintained access to Jenkins logs for audit and debugging
- ✅ Improved performance and focus on critical log sources
- ✅ Automated archival and cleanup for better maintainability
